# weather-website

In this project, I have build a website that will fetch weather information from an API with latitude,longitude query if the user give their location access else the user can search for their city by their city names. This website will give information like sunrise time, sunset time, humidity,visibility, pressure, wind speed, temperature, feels like and weather description.
